Typescene is a robust front end library written in TypeScript: strongly typed, no dependencies, no nonsense.

## TODO

A few very important tasks are currently still pending:

* Tests, lots of 'em. The core package now comes with a test harness but only very few tests. These need to be added in some kind of structural way. Perhaps this can be organized using a Github project, opinions welcome on Twitter please.
* More tests for the `@typescene/webapp` package. These probably need an automated browser-based test framework. Opinions welcome on Twitter please.
* More examples for the reference documentation. These need to be added to the `typescene.github.io` repo on GitHub.
* More sample projects, along with articles on how they work. Before publishing these we're happy to review your own samples, please DM on Twitter.
* A better way to set up a new project using Typescene. Looking at `npm init`, possibly `degit`, or a plain old CLI.
* More prebuilt components (calendars, combo buttons, etc). See `typescene-treegrid` on GitHub for a full featured example.
