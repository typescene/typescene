## TODO

A few very important tasks are currently still pending:

- Tests, lots of 'em. The core package now comes with a test harness but only very few tests. These need to be added in some kind of structural way. Perhaps this can be organized using a Github project, opinions welcome on Twitter please.
- More tests for the `@typescene/webapp` package. These probably need an automated browser-based test framework. Opinions welcome on Twitter please.
- More examples for the reference documentation. These need to be added to the `typescene.github.io` repo on GitHub.
- More sample projects, along with articles on how they work. Before publishing these we're happy to review your own samples, please DM on Twitter.
- More prebuilt components (calendars, combo buttons, etc). See `typescene-treegrid` on GitHub for a full featured example.
