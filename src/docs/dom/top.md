**Typescene** is a strongly typed front-end toolkit for modern web applications built with TypeScript. It combines best practices from the realms of traditional desktop GUI development, mobile app development, and JavaScript web development in a single framework.

Why build web apps with Typescene?

* **Single-source development** -- everything written in TypeScript, no need to switch among HTML, CSS and JS files.
* **Intuitive & object-oriented** -- modeled after desktop GUI toolkits, mixed with convenient Javascript-isms where possible to keep things DRY.
* **Transparent async programming** -- no 'magic' variables, no forced functional paradigms.
* **Strong typing** -- TypeScript 2+ for top-notch static type checks and IDE auto-complete.
* **Support for IE9+** and all modern browsers.

Typescene encourages developers to write readable, refactorable, coherent code in a single strongly-typed code base, while still taking advantage of the benefits that the modern JavaScript environment offers.
