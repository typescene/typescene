Not in the way things were done in the 1990s, but in a much cleaner way. Tables still have interesting properties which make them work very well for UI layouts: they have special rules concerning margins and padding, which is very useful to <em>contain elements</em> that would otherwise interact with each other in unpredictable ways.</p>\n<p>Secondly, it lets us define horizontal layout in terms of <em>filling up the available row space</em>, without hardcoding <em>all</em> of the required widths. Very useful when ‘shrinkwrapped’ components (as small as possible) are mixed with e.g. text input elements that need to be expanded (to fill up horizontal space). Combined with a ‘spacer’ element that takes up space but does not contain any elements (a blank table cell), this lets you define most common layouts very quickly without any explicit measurements.</p>\n<p>The CSS ‘flexbox’ engine can also be used in the same way, but is not available on all supported browsers. Since the actual DOM rendering engine is separate from the Component classes themselves, a flexbox option can be developed independently (but is not ready yet).</p>\n<p>Examples of row layouts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For a simple text field with a button to its right, you can use a row containing a <code>[ TextField, Button ]</code>, since textfields always auto-expand (shrinkwrap = false, by default), while buttons do not (shrinkwrap = true).</li>\n<li>For a row with one button on the left and one on the right, use <code>[ Button, Spacer, Button ]</code> components.</li>\n<li>For a row with one button in the middle, use <code>[ Spacer, Button, Spacer ]</code>. For two buttons, just add the button between the spacers, like <code>[ Spacer, Button, Button, Spacer ]</code>.</li>\n<li>For a two-column layout, use a row with two ControlStack components or two ContainerControl components (which can all have nested rows).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Components in a row are always vertically aligned to the middle of all other components, unless configured otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>Block layout</strong> — Outside of rows, the normal rules of HTML layout apply. Blocks (such as Rows themselves) stack on top of each other, and may or may not have an explicit height defined. <code>Table</code>, <code>List</code>, and <code>TreeList</code> components make it easy to create uniform grid and list layouts. They also provide logic for selecting list elements by clicking on them or using the arrow keys.</p>\n<p><strong>Containers</strong> — To wrap everything up, containers contain lists of blocks. These are usually displayed full-screen, or within other components. There are also <code>DialogContainer</code> and <code>DrawerContainer</code> classes that can be used to display dialog and drawer (modal) overlays. The <code>LayoutContainer</code> component can be used to quickly define layouts in “NSEW” style, with 4 possible sub container slots surrounding its main content region.</p>\n"},{"title":"Object Orientation","content":"<p>Inspired by desktop UI toolkits, the Typescene UI module defines components through a hierarchy of classes. For example, a <code>TextField</code> derives properties and methods from <code>InputControl</code>, which derives from <code>ControlElement</code>, which derives from <code>Component</code>. This makes it easy to define structured layouts, e.g. the <code>Row</code> component has a <code>content</code> property with an array of <code>ControlElement</code> objects. The <code>Container</code> component’s <code>content</code> property is an array of <code>Block</code> objects (such as <code>Row</code> instances).</p>\n<p>With this object oriented structure you <em>could</em> implement your UI as follows, in the style of Java Spring UI components:</p>\n"},{"title":"Primitive Example: Not Recommended","type":"example","displayResult":"myButton","content":"<pre><code class=\"language-typescript\">var myTextField = new UI.TextField(&quot;text&quot;);\nmyTextField.placeholderText = &quot;Your name&quot;;\nmyTextField.hasFocus = true;\nvar myRow = new UI.Row();\nmyRow.content.push(myTextField);\nvar myContainer = new UI.DialogContainer();\nmyContainer.content.push(myRow);\nlet hide = () =&gt; { myContainer.close() };\nvar hideButton = new UI.Button(&quot;Hide&quot;);\nhideButton.Clicked.connect(hide);\nmyContainer.content.push(new UI.Row([hideButton]));\nlet show = () =&gt; { myContainer.display() };\nvar myButton = new UI.Button(&quot;Click me&quot;);\nmyButton.Clicked.connect(show);\n</code></pre>\n"},{"title":"","content":"<p>However, this quickly becomes tedious, and you may easily lose track of the overall component hierarchy.

There is no “magic” happening in the background, nothing that is not explicitly expressed in the code. Except in the case of <em>observable values</em> (or observable properties), which most properties on Component instances are.</p>\n<p>This means that, for example, setting <code>.width</code> on a dialog component will have an effect on the appearance of the dialog without having to call an <code>update</code> or <code>render</code> function. In fact, the <code>render</code> function is there, but it is used to generate “observable” output — observed by parent components and finally the <code>Page</code> class while the component is displayed. The output then depends on a number of other observable properties (marked with the Async library’s observable decorator). Once one or more of those properties change while observed by a visible <code>Page</code>, the <code>render</code> function is called again <em>asynchronously</em> (but not necessarily the render functions of nested components, if those didn’t also change) to update the DOM.</p>\n<p>You can also use asynchronous constructs in your UI code directly. The easiest method to achieve this is with bindings (one or two-way) in an initializer, which watch and/or update a property on the main view component, i.e. the one that the initializer was applied to.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can use the Async library yourself to generate and consume observable values.

For example, an initializer could contain an observable value (result of <code>Async.observe</code>) instead of any component factory. The observable value can then take any value at runtime: a component instance (e.g. depending on the value of some other property), a component class, or <em>another component initializer</em>, with more observables and factories.</p>\n<p>This enables a more functional style of programming, where changes in state (or initial values) ‘bubble up’ through a hierarchy of asynchronous transformation functions encapsulated in observable values. The final step would be the component factory initializer transformation, to create a Component instance and render it as part of its parent.</p>\n<p>With this functional style, an application’s UI code base could be greatly simplified. However in some cases this also makes the flow of data harder to understand— which is why Typescene always provides the option to update your UI using a more ‘imperative’ style.
